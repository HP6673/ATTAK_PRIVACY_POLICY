    <h1>Privacy Policy for ATTAK</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and practices of ATTAK (“ATTAK,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) concerning the collection, processing, storage, retention, protection, and disclosure of information obtained in connection with the access to or use of ATTAK’s websites, applications, platforms, software, and related products or services (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to all users, visitors, and others who interact with the Services.</p>

    <p>By accessing, browsing, registering for, or otherwise using the Services, you acknowledge, represent, and warrant that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the practices described herein, you must discontinue use of the Services.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>ATTAK may collect, receive, generate, or otherwise process information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with an individual or device. Such information may be collected either actively, through user submission, or passively, through automated means arising from interaction with the Services.</p>

    <p>Information voluntarily provided by users may include, without limitation, names, aliases, usernames, email addresses, authentication credentials, account profile information, communications, content submissions, feedback, and any other information that users elect to transmit or make available through the Services. Submission of such information is voluntary; however, certain features or functionalities of the Services may not be available absent the provision of required information.</p>

    <p>In addition to information provided directly by users, ATTAK may automatically collect certain information relating to the device, network, or method by which the Services are accessed. This may include internet protocol addresses, device identifiers, hardware models, operating systems, browser types, language preferences, approximate geographic location, referral and exit pages, date and time stamps, interaction logs, error reports, diagnostic data, and other usage metrics. Such information is collected to ensure operational integrity, security, performance optimization, analytics, and system administration.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>The Services may employ cookies, pixels, software development kits, local storage objects, and similar tracking or identification technologies to facilitate authentication, maintain session continuity, store preferences, analyze trends, administer the Services, and improve user experience. These technologies may collect information automatically but do not permit ATTAK to access personal files or content stored on a user’s device. Users may restrict or disable such technologies through device or browser settings, though doing so may impair functionality.</p>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>Information collected or processed by ATTAK is used solely for lawful and legitimate business purposes. These purposes include, but are not limited to, providing, operating, maintaining, supporting, securing, and improving the Services; managing user accounts and relationships; responding to inquiries and support requests; communicating administrative, technical, or legal notices; monitoring and enforcing compliance with applicable terms, policies, and laws; detecting, preventing, and mitigating fraud, abuse, or security incidents; conducting internal research and analytics; and fulfilling contractual or legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure and Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>ATTAK does not sell personal information. For the avoidance of doubt, ATTAK does not disclose personal data to third parties in exchange for monetary consideration or other valuable consideration, nor does ATTAK engage in the commercial trade, brokerage, or monetization of user data. Personal information collected by ATTAK is not treated as a commercial asset for resale.</p>

    <p>ATTAK may disclose or make available certain information to third-party vendors, contractors, consultants, or service providers that perform services on our behalf and under our instructions, such as infrastructure hosting, data analytics, security monitoring, customer support, or communications delivery. Such disclosures are limited to the minimum amount of information necessary to perform the relevant services, and such parties are contractually obligated to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the data and to refrain from selling or using it for unauthorized purposes.</p>

    <p>ATTAK may also disclose information where required to do so by applicable law, regulation, legal process, subpoena, court order, or governmental authority, or where ATTAK reasonably believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of ATTAK, its users, or others, to investigate potential violations of law or policy, or to enforce contractual obligations.</p>

    <h2>Security and International Transfers</h2>
    <p>ATTAK implements and maintains reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information from unauthorized access, acquisition, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure. Such safeguards may include access controls, encryption, monitoring, logging, internal policies, and employee training. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no security measure is infallible, and ATTAK cannot guarantee that information will be immune from unauthorized access or misuse.</p>

    <p>The Services may be accessed globally. By using the Services, users acknowledge and consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of information in jurisdictions that may not provide the same level of data protection as the user’s country of residence.</p>

    <h2>User Rights and Minors</h2>
    <p>Depending on the jurisdiction in which a user resides, users may be entitled to certain rights with respect to their personal information, including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, portability, and objection. Where applicable, users may exercise such rights by submitting a request through ATTAK’s designated contact channels, subject to verification of identity and applicable legal limitations.</p>

    <p>The Services are not directed to individuals under the minimum age required by applicable law, and ATTAK does not knowingly collect personal information from such individuals. If ATTAK becomes aware that it has inadvertently collected personal data from a minor without appropriate authorization, it will take reasonable steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>ATTAK may retain and store information collected in connection with the Services in electronic or other formats on systems owned or controlled by ATTAK or its authorized service providers. Data may be retained for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, to maintain the Services, to comply with legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements, to resolve disputes, to enforce agreements, and to protect the security and integrity of the Services.</p>

    <p>Retention periods may vary depending on the nature, sensitivity, and purpose of the data, as well as applicable legal obligations. Where feasible and appropriate, ATTAK may anonymize, aggregate, or de-identify data so that it can no longer be associated with an identifiable individual.</p>

    <p>When information is no longer required for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, ATTAK will take reasonable steps to securely delete, destroy, or render such information inaccessible, subject to applicable laws and legitimate business needs. ATTAK periodically reviews its data retention practices to ensure alignment with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Amendments</h2>
    <p>ATTAK reserves the right to modify, amend, or update this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in legal requirements, business practices, or the functionality of the Services. Any such modifications will become effective upon posting, and continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
